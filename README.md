Table of contents:
| # | Title | Description |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| 01 | [Introduction](chapter01/README.md) | In this chapter, we explore the motivation behind multimedia retrieval, trace its historical development, and outline the generic retrieval process along with its variations. We also introduce fundamental machine learning concepts that will be applied in later chapters. |
| 02 | [Evaluation](chapter02/README.md) | This chapter focuses on evaluating and comparing retrieval systems and machine learning approaches. This serves as the foundation for assessing the effectiveness of methods discussed in most chapters.
| 03 | [Classic Text Retrieval](chapter03/README.md) | We delve into classical text retrieval models, with a special emphasis on vector space retrieval. Additionally, we explore Lucene, OpenSearch, and Elasticsearch, showcasing the capabilities of these models.
| 04 | [Advanced Text Retrieval](chapter04/README.md) | Examining natural language processing using NLTK as an example, this chapter also explores modern methods for creating embeddings and leveraging generative AI to enhance retrieval results.
| 05 | [Web & Social Retrieval](chapter05/README.md) | Focusing on web and social media retrieval, this chapter explores methods to influence rankings based on document relationships.
| 06 | [Vector Search](chapter06/README.md) | We explore the challenge of searching through embeddings and feature vectors. Contemporary techniques used by products like Lucene, OpenSearch, and Elasticsearch are studied, along with an exploration of the "curse of dimensionality."
| 07 | [Basic Image Retrieval](chapter07/README.md) | Human perception of visual signal information is covered, along with algorithms for extracting color, texture, and shape features found in images.
| 08 | [Advanced Image Retrieval](chapter08/README.md) | Deep learning and neural networks are delved into in this chapter. These techniques are applied to extract higher-level features, including classifications, facial recognition, and object bounding boxes.
| 09 | [Basic Audio Retrieval](chapter09/README.md) | Human perception of audio signals is explored, studying algorithms for extracting features in both time and frequency domains. The unique case of extracting musical features is also discussed.
| 10 | [Basic Video Retrieval](chapter10/README.md) | Fundamental aspects of motion detection and video segmentation are discussed. The focus is on identifying visual patterns in video content.
| 11 | [ML Methods](chapter11/README.md) | Essential machine learning methods for content analysis and metadata extraction are covered in this chapter. These concepts are revisited and applied throughout the course.
